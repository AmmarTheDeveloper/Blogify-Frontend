## Features

### Authentication
Blogify ensures secure access to your account with robust authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This means only authorized users can log in and access the platform, providing a safe environment for sharing content.

### Password Caching
Blogify employs password caching to optimize authentication processes and enhance user experience. When a user successfully logs in, their encrypted password is temporarily stored in the cache memory. This allows for quicker authentication during subsequent login attempts, as the system can compare the cached password directly instead of querying the database each time.

### Password Management
Forgot your password? No problem! With Blogify's password management feature, users can easily reset their passwords. An OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to the user's registered email address for verification, ensuring a seamless and secure password recovery process.
